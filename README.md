~Change in direction due to data set/API issues!~

A basic app designed for skincare shoppers who want to be mindful where their money goes. Shoppers can see **how ethical and sustainable** skin care brands are before purchasing! 

##  🔍 About

With skincare being an almost 200 billion dollar industry, such influence leads to a higher impact on the environment, people, and animals. Through data scraping (with lovely BeautifulSoup) and utilizing Streamlit, users are capable of viewing ethical information on top skincare brands from The Good Shopping Guide (GSG)- having provided ethical brands ratings and accreditation since 2001!

It will allow users to:

- View 47 popular skin care brands from the GSG website.
- View ethical ratings in regards to the environment, people, animals, etc.
- View each brands' GSG Ethical Score.
- View brands in rank order and search brands with scores within a certain range
- Have access to an interactive webapp

## 🤓 Tools & Tech

##  🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Collaboration(?)

This app is being made solo! If time (and energy) permits, I plan to expand the app include more complex features like allowing complex queries, charts, and/or hyperlinks.

## ✍️ Notes

- Initial version will focus on search + basic display.
- Info depth is still being decided. At minimum, the app will display requested brand information from user and be visualized through streamlit.
